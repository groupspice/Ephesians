<noscript> Leader’s Notesthat God does have a purpose and power in our lives that we will discover as we study the book of Ephesians together.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.This session covers all of Ephesians chapter 1. Reading the entire selection aloud may be time-consuming so we recommend that you ask the group to read these passages at home before coming to the group.4. Paul probably wants his readers to think about who they are, their identity as believers. They should think of themselves as “holy,” set apart for God’s purpose. He’ll discuss faith/faithfulness later in this book, and he’ll use the phrase “in Christ Jesus” over and over. The words “in Ephesus” are not present in the three earliest manuscripts. Therefore, this was very likely a circular letter, meaning the name of each local church would be  lled in as the letter circulated from church to church. We can also learn some things about Paul from this greeting: he is an apostle and has a calling from God.6. God chose (past tense) us out for himself—namely, out of the world (see Gal. 1:4). That God chose us forms the basis of the doctrine of election (see the Study Notes in this session for more information). God does not save us because we deserve it, but because he graciously and freely gives salvation according to his plan. We did not in uence God’s decision to save us; thus, we cannot take credit for our salvation. God’s purpose in choosing us was so that we would live changed lives henceforth. To be “holy” means to be set apart for God in order to re ect his nature.7. “Through his [Christ’s] blood” is the key phrase. You could talk at length about how Christ’s death buys you out of sin and death. Romans 10:9–10 (NIV) says “that if you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and be- lieve in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justi ed, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” When we do this, an ex- change takes place. We give Christ our sins, and he gives us freedom and forgiveness—redemption.8. God’s kindness is showered on believers abundantly and extravagantly— lavishly. The mystery is God’s revealed plan to bring people, both Jews and Gentiles, back into fellowship with himself through their faith in Christ and then to keep them with him for all eternity.9. God reveals himself to his people through the presence of the Holy Spirit in their lives. The Holy Spirit  lls us with a sense of God’s love (Rom. 5:5),114 </noscript>
