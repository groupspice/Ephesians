        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overemphasize one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship. Rarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, ministry, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a memory verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection withGod and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn6]]></text>

You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker ques- tion, and/or you can check in with one or two group members—your spiritual partner(s)—for a deeper connection and encouragement in your spiritual journey.DVD TEACHING SEGMENT. A Deepening Life Together: Ephe- sians Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is avail- able. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Mike Meeks. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discussion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section). At the end of each session in this study guide, you will  nd space for your notes on the teach- ing segment.GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core pas- sages you’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. The focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.7]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstSHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’s scary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy schedules. But Jesus wanted all of his disciples to help outsiders con- nect with him, to know him personally. This doesn’t mean preaching on street corners. It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.Study NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (Optional)If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more biblical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide8]]></text>

These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group.You can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.9]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONWelcome to the Deepening Life Together Bible study on Ephesians. As we live this Bible study experience together, we will unpack prin- ciples from God’s Word that reveal God’s divine purpose and plan of bringing redemption to his people and the outworking of that purpose in the life of the believer.The letter to the Ephesians covers a vast amount of doctrine and practice in a very short space. It is one of four “prison letters” (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon) probably writ- ten during Paul’s  rst Roman imprisonment, around AD 60 (see Acts 28:3–31).This journey through the book of Ephesians will connect you with our loving and faithful God and with other believers. For some of you, this might be the  rst time you’ve connected in a small group community. We want you to know that God cares about you and your spiritual growth. As you prayerfully respond to the principles you learn in this study, God will move you to a deeper level of com- mitment and intimacy with himself, as well as with those in your small group.We at Baker Books and Lifetogether Publishing look forward to hearing the stories of how God changes you from the inside out during this small group experience. We pray God blesses you with all he has planned for you through this journey together.For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.Psalm 100:5 (NIV)10]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION ONEMemory Verse: Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ (Eph. 1:3 NIV).A principal claim of the Internet is information on demand. One can look up information on just about any topic, any time of the day or night. But having information available doesn’t assure understanding; we must take the information in, digest it, question it, and accept it before it can be of any value to us.The same applies to Scripture; only when we read and understand it deeply and thoroughly will we begin to understand it to the point that we begin to question the way we live. Just knowing that we have been “blessed . . . in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing” (Eph. 1:3) should energize our gratitude and boost our self-esteem, but knowledge of this alone will not help us attain it.In Ephesians chapter 1, Paul reveals God’s eternal purpose and plan for every believer. God has chosen and saved each of us for redemption and secured for us a promised inheritance. Together we will embrace the reality of God’s perfect plan and allow it to moti- vate us to trust him in every area of life, with his purpose becoming our life’s mission.11AN ALMIGHTY GOD, A GLORIOUS CHURCH]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[EphesiansConnectingBegin your group time with prayer. Ask God to open your hearts to receive his Word through this Bible study and for the courage to change as he challenges you in the weeks to come.Deeper relationships happen when we take the time to keep in touch with one another. As you begin, pass around a copy of the Small Group Roster, a sheet of paper, or one of you pass your study guide, opened to the Small Group Roster. When the roster gets to you, write down your contact information, including the best time and method for contacting you. Then, someone volunteer to make copies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, and what you do for fun. You may also include whether or not you are married, how long you have been married, how many children you have and their ages. Also share what brought you to this small group study of Ephesians and what you expect to learn during the next seven sessions.2. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your group values together. In the Appendix is a Small Group Agreement with the values we’ve found most useful in sustaining healthy, balanced groups. We recommend that you review these values and choose one or two—values you haven’t previously focused on or have room to grow in—to emphasize during this study. Choose values that will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health. Discuss how you will implement these values in your small group.3. What would you say is God’s purpose for your life, as you understand it now? If you don’t know, make a guess.12]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[An Almighty God, a Glorious ChurchGrowingAfter greeting the church at Ephesus, Paul gives praise to God as he reveals to his readers God’s eternal purpose and plan for every believer.Please read Ephesians 1.4. Paul customarily begins his letters with a greeting. See the Study Notes for more insight into Paul. Reread Ephesians 1:1–2. What do you think Paul means to communicate by addressing his readers as “God’s holy people” and “the faithful in Christ Jesus”?5. In Ephesians 1:3–14, Paul gives praise to God for the spiritual blessings that we have received in Christ. The chart below out- lines some of these. Read them aloud with their corresponding verse and discuss how each of these is integral to God’s master plan for salvation.In Christ I am . . . (v. 3a)Blessed (v. 3b)Chosen (v. 4)Predestined (v. 5)Adopted (v. 5)Accepted (v. 6)Redeemed (v. 7)Forgiven (v. 7)Enlightened (vv. 8–9)Scripture: Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . . .. . . who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love . . .. . . he predestined us . . .

(see Study Notes for insight). . . the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace . . .. . . that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.

Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit . . .. . . who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the re- demption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.Ephesians6. Read Ephesians 1:4–7. What do we learn from these verses about God’s purpose for choosing us to be adopted as his sons (and daughters)?How does it feel to know that God chose you before the cre- ation of the world?7. How does one receive redemption and forgiveness of sins ac- cording to verse 7? (See the Study Notes for a de nition of redemption.)What further insight does Peter give into our redemption in 1 Peter 1:18–21?8. Read Ephesians 1:8–10. What is the signi cance of saying God has “lavished” his grace on us?What is the “mystery” spoken of in verse 9? See the Study Notes for help understanding the mystery.9. What is the Holy Spirit’s role in a believer’s life according to Ephesians 1:13–14?How does God’s blessing of the Holy Spirit serve as a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance (or pledge of our inheritance)?10.

        <text><![CDATA[An Almighty God, a Glorious ChurchWhy do you think spiritual enlightenment is necessary in order for believers to fully comprehend the hope to which they were called?12. Read Paul’s description of the power of God in Ephesians 1:18–23. How does this power become accessible to us?How can God’s power empower you in your daily life as you walk with Jesus?In this  rst chapter of Paul’s letter to the church at Ephesus, Paul reveals to his readers God’s eternal purpose and plan for the church. According to this plan, God chose and saved his people for redemp- tion that is available through the sacri cial death of Jesus Christ and secures for the redeemed a promised inheritance. It is Paul’s earnest prayer for the Ephesian Christians, and all Christians, that they may fully realize God’s purpose and power in their lives.DevelopingGod created us to serve him and has given every believer special gifts to be used in service as the Holy Spirit leads. The  rst step in developing the gifts that God has given each of us is to deepen our relationship with him through prayer, re ection, and meditation on his Word. Through these disciplines, we learn how to hear his voice and submit to the leading of the Holy Spirit.13. Developing our ability to serve God according to the leading of the Holy Spirit requires that we make time to let God speak to us daily. Which of the following next steps toward this goal are you willing to take for the next few weeks?t Prayer. Commit to connecting with God daily through per- sonal prayer. It’s important to separate yourself from the distractions in your life so you can really focus on commu- nicating with God. Some people  nd it helpful to write out their prayers in a journal.15]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Ephesianst Re ection. At the end of each session, you’ll  nd Re ections Scriptures that speci cally relate to the topic of our study for the session. These are provided to give you an opportunity for reading a short Bible passage  ve days a week during the course of this study. Write down your insights on what you read each day in the space provided. On the sixth day, summarize what God has shown you throughout the week.t Meditation. Psalm 119:11 says, “I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you” (NIV). Medita- tion is focused attention on the Word of God and is a great way to internalize God’s Word more deeply. One way to do this is to write a portion of Scripture on a card and tape it somewhere where you’re sure to see it often, such as your bathroom mirror, car’s dashboard, or the kitchen table. Think about it as you get dressed in the morning, when you sit at red lights, or while you’re eating a meal. Re ect on what God is saying to you through his words. Consider using the passages provided in the Re ections pages in each session. As you meditate upon these Scriptures, you will notice them beginning to take up residence in your heart and mind.SharingJesus lived and died so that mankind might come to know him and be reconciled to God through him. His  nal words before his ascension recorded in Acts 1:8 were, “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth” (NIV). Through the Holy Spirit, we are empowered to be his witnesses to those around us.14. Jesus wants all of his disciples to help others connect with him, to know him personally. In the weeks to come, you’ll be asked to identify and share with people in your circle of in uence who need to know Jesus or need to connect with him through a small group community. With this in mind, as you go about16]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[An Almighty God, a Glorious Churchyour day-to-day activities this week, pay special attention to the people God has placed in your life. There may be co-workers, family or friends, or other parents at school or sporting events, that you see or talk to on a regular basis. When we meet next time, we’ll talk about how to help connect believers to Chris- tian community and begin sharing Jesus with those who don’t yet know him.SurrenderingGod wants us to turn our hearts to him. Second Chronicles 16:9 says,“The eyes of the Lord search the whole earth in order to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him” (NLT). Each week you will have a chance to surrender your hearts to God in worship and prayer.15. Consider some di erent ways to worship that might  t your group. Following are a few ideas. Spend a few minutes wor- shiping God together.t Have someone use their musical gifts to lead the group in a worship song. You might sing a simple chorus a cappella, with guitar/piano accompaniment, or with a worship CD.t Read a passage of Scripture aloud together, making it a time of praise and worship as the words remind you of all God has done for you. Choose a psalm or other favorite verses.t Spend a few minutes praising God aloud. You may highlight some of the attributes of God’s character or praise him for speci c circumstances in your life.16. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. Your time with God is personal and re ects who you are in relationship with God. However you choose to spend your time with him, try to allow time for praise, prayer, and reading of Scripture. Re ections are provided at the end of each session for you to use as part of your daily time with God. These will o er reinforcement of the principles you are17]]></text>

Before you close your group in prayer, answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report and commit to praying for each other throughout the week.Study NotesDoctrine of Election: The doctrine of election teaches that we are saved only because of God’s grace and mercy; as believers we are not saved by our own merit. It focuses on God’s purpose or will (1:5, 9, 11), not on ours.Paul: Paul (known also as Saul) was a Jew from the tribe of Benja- min. He was raised as a strict Pharisee (see below) (Phil. 3:5), grew up in Tarsus, and was educated under a well-known Jewish rabbi, Gamaliel (Acts 22:3). He was also a Roman citizen, a fact that he used to great advantage at times (Acts 22:27–29). As a zealous Jew, Saul considered Christians to be dangerous opponents of Judaism and Jesus to be a false Messiah. He began persecuting the church until, on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus, he was confronted by the resurrected Christ. At that moment Saul realized that the one he had been persecuting was God’s Messiah, the Savior of the world, and he devoted the rest of his life to serving him. Saul the persecutor became Paul the apostle of Jesus Christ.Pharisees: The Pharisees were a religious party within Judaism who strictly kept the law of Moses and the unwritten “tradition of the elders.”Mystery: The term “mystery,” as used by Paul, means something unknown in ages past but now revealed to the people of God. The book of Ephesians is an exposition of God’s mystery about Christ. The  rst chapter is largely an expression of divine purpose. Chapter 2 shows God working out the mystery through his grace. Chapter 318]]></text>
    </page>
    <page pageNumber="19">
        <text><![CDATA[An Almighty God, a Glorious Churchsays the mystery is divinely revealed through Christ and associated with God’s divine wisdom (3:9). What was not previously known was that all things will be brought into right relationship with Christ. In the meantime God is working out his mystery in the church, which is composed of all people in one body, Jews and Gentiles alike.Heavenly Realms (Places): The phrases heavenly realms or heavenly places occur  ve times in Ephesians (1:3, 20; 2:6; 3:10; 6:12). It refers to the domain beyond the material world where the ultimate con ict between good and evil takes place. This con ict continues but has already been won by Christ’s death and resurrection. This is the realm in which the spiritual blessings were secured for us and then given to us. Our blessings come from heaven, where Christ now lives (1:20), and Christ’s gift of the Holy Spirit, the source of all spiritual blessings, came as a result of his ascension to heaven (4:8). Paul is making the point that these blessings are spiritual and not material; thus, they are eternal and not temporal.Predestined: To predestine is to choose, determine, or set apart be- forehand. Believers receive an inheritance from God because they are predestined according to his purpose (Eph. 1:11). God knows before we are born whether we will believe and receive the inheritance.Redemption: A word occurring nine times in Scripture, and always with the idea of a ransom or price paid. Most occurrences of apo- lutrôsis denote the redemption provided by Christ through his death on the cross. In Ephesians 1:7, it describes something that believers have right now. However, in many occurrences of this word in Scrip- ture, there is a future aspect to redemption, which believers will not experience fully until Jesus returns.Eyes of Your Heart: When Scripture refers to the heart in this context, it covers the whole range of activities that go on within one’s inner self, including thinking, grieving, rejoicing, desiring, understanding, and decision making.19]]></text>

But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a fewpeopleorforexistinggroupsthatloseafewpeoplealongtheway. We encourage you to pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another good strategy is to ask church leaders to make an announcement that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too71]]></text>

The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s totally up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months together, but every other week can work as well. We strongly recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if at all possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch relationships that last for years, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direction, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have something to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will ma- ture and members will share the facilitation of meetings. We have discovered that healthy groups share hosting and leading of the group. This model ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.72]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. You may try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to meet in the living room or dining room, and share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can be with the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their children all evening when their children are too young to be left at home. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the responsi- bility of providing a lesson or care for the children either in the same home or in another home nearby. This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. No mat- ter what decision the group makes, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.73]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One An Almighty God, a Glorious ChurchConnecting1. We’ve designed this study for both new and established groups, and for both seekers and the spiritually mature. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other. Established groups often want to dig deeper into Bible study and application. Regardless of whether your group is new or has been together for a while, be sure to answer this introductory question at this  rst session.2. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.As part of this discussion, we recommend talking about shared owner- ship of the group. It’s important that each member have a role. See the Appendix to learn more about Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.3. Note that this is a “what do you think” question. As such, there is no right or wrong answer. This question is intended to focus the group on the idea113LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notesthat God does have a purpose and power in our lives that we will discover as we study the book of Ephesians together.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.This session covers all of Ephesians chapter 1. Reading the entire selection aloud may be time-consuming so we recommend that you ask the group to read these passages at home before coming to the group.4. Paul probably wants his readers to think about who they are, their identity as believers. They should think of themselves as “holy,” set apart for God’s purpose. He’ll discuss faith/faithfulness later in this book, and he’ll use the phrase “in Christ Jesus” over and over. The words “in Ephesus” are not present in the three earliest manuscripts. Therefore, this was very likely a circular letter, meaning the name of each local church would be  lled in as the letter circulated from church to church. We can also learn some things about Paul from this greeting: he is an apostle and has a calling from God.6. God chose (past tense) us out for himself—namely, out of the world (see Gal. 1:4). That God chose us forms the basis of the doctrine of election (see the Study Notes in this session for more information). God does not save us because we deserve it, but because he graciously and freely gives salvation according to his plan. We did not in uence God’s decision to save us; thus, we cannot take credit for our salvation. God’s purpose in choosing us was so that we would live changed lives henceforth. To be “holy” means to be set apart for God in order to re ect his nature.7. “Through his [Christ’s] blood” is the key phrase. You could talk at length about how Christ’s death buys you out of sin and death. Romans 10:9–10 (NIV) says “that if you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and be- lieve in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justi ed, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” When we do this, an ex- change takes place. We give Christ our sins, and he gives us freedom and forgiveness—redemption.8. God’s kindness is showered on believers abundantly and extravagantly— lavishly. The mystery is God’s revealed plan to bring people, both Jews and Gentiles, back into fellowship with himself through their faith in Christ and then to keep them with him for all eternity.9. God reveals himself to his people through the presence of the Holy Spirit in their lives. The Holy Spirit  lls us with a sense of God’s love (Rom. 5:5),114]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notesassures us that God has adopted us as his children (Rom. 8:15–16), and helps us to demonstrate Christ through out lives. The Holy Spirit is God’s guarantee that he will give believers everything he promised. The Spirit is the  rst payment of all the treasures that will be ours because he has purchased us to be his own people. The presence of the Holy Spirit in us proves that we are God’s children and secures eternal life for us. His power works in us to transform us now, and what we experience now is a taste of the total change we will experience in eternity.10. Paul asked that God would give the Ephesian believers spiritual wisdom and understanding. Wisdom is the ability to see life from God’s perspective—to have discernment. Understanding refers to an enlightened knowledge of God.11. In the Bible the “heart” is the center of one’s personhood or being. Paul prayed that the believers might have true spiritual insight into God. Spiritual enlightenment is necessary, because while the information about Christ is available to anyone who chooses to read the Bible, it doesn’t fully sink in without God’s help.12. The power is available “for us who believe.” Faith is necessary. Only God’s power can change weak human beings into strong believers who are willing to sacri ce everything for the God who loves them. With the second part of this question, try to get practical. Consistent attention to the Holy Spirit is important for accessing his power.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.13. The intent of this question is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes a life. The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage everyone to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.115]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesSharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.14. Encourage the group to observe their interactions during the coming week with the intention of using these observations next week in evaluating the people that God has placed in their lives that he might want them to share with or invite to your small group.Surrendering16. Encourage group members to use the Re ections verses in their daily quiet time throughout the week. This will move them closer to God while rein- forcing the lesson of this session through related Scripture.17. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept con dent if you are to have safety and bonding among group members.Use the Prayer and Praise Report in the Appendix to record your prayer requests. There you can keep track of requests and celebrate answers to prayer.Session Two Before and After ChristConnecting2. We encourage the group to rotate hosts/leaders and homes each meeting. This practice will go a long way toward bonding the group. Review the Small Group Calendar and talk about who else is willing to open their home or facilitate a meeting. Rotating host homes and leadership along with implementing Team Roles as discussed in Session One will quickly move the group ownership from “your group” to “our group.”GrowingThis session covers all of Ephesians chapter 2. Reading the entire selection aloud may be time-consuming so we recommend that you ask the group to read these passages at home before coming to the group.116]]></text>
